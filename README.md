# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

This project is a recreation of the [freeCodeCamp Frontend Web Development: In-Depth Project Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) course project. The project focuses on implementing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in JavaScript and TypeScript, along with HTML and CSS.

Throughout the course, I learned about the MVC pattern and its implementation in JavaScript and TypeScript. I rewrote the provided code, made improvements, and performed extensive refactoring to enhance the project's functionality, code structure, and maintainability.

## Features

- Utilizes the MVC architecture for separation of concerns and code organization
- Implements the game logic and UI using JavaScript and TypeScript
- Supports a user-friendly interface with improved visuals and responsiveness
- Includes event handling and interactive features for a dynamic user experience
- Implements game reset and new round functionality
- Displays player turns and game status
- Supports a flexible game layout with upgrade options

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- React.js
